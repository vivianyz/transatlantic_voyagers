        <h2>The Imperia Project</h2>
        <p>The Imperiia Project is supported by a Digital Humanities Advancement Grant from the National Endowment for the Humanities, and by the Davis Center for Russian and Eurasian Studies at Harvard University. Our project documents, interrogates, visualizes, and interprets the history of Imperial Russia. In other words, we are building a spatial history of the Russian Empire. </p>
        <p>In other phases of the project we create databases and make maps. Here we tease out the narrative threads that run through our archive. This is where we tell stories and push the boundaries of narrative. This is where you can see the empire through a pack of playing cards. Learn the history of Kamchatka in a dozen maps. Immerse yourself in the Putrid Sea. Voyage down the Volga River on the eve of World War I. This is where we demonstrate that every shred of the historical record is part of a dense fabric of connections in which every location, every event, every thought, every...thing, has a place. </p>
