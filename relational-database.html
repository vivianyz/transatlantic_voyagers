        <h1>Relational Database</h1>
        <h2>Description</h2>
        <p>A significant milestone of our research work is the publication of the Tsar's Trans-Atlantic Voyagers dataset, a relational database accompanied with vector data, documenting the migration of over half a million subjects of the Russian Empire to the United States between 1834 and 1897.</p>
        <p>It allows researchers to study the frequency and scale of trans-Atlantic voyages, the movement of immigrants from the Russian Empire to an array of (mainly) European ports, and eventually to destination ports on the Eastern seaboard of the U.S. Researchers can study the demographic and occupational profiles of all immigrants. TTAV is a relational database accompanied with vector data (in other words, location data for all ports, all prominent last known residences, and with schematic itinerary descriptions of all voyage routes).Â </p>
