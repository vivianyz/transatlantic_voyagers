        <ol>
            <li><strong>Data Preparation and Standardization Phase:</strong> incorporates a combination of meticulous manual examination and Business Intelligence tools to detect inaccuracies, bridge data discontinuities, and facilitate effective data categorization of data derived from archival records.</li>
            <li><strong>Exploratory Data Analysis Phase:</strong> involves identify patterns in various aspects, such as gender distribution, occupations, and travel groups, and alongside anomaly detection to preserve the historical records' authenticity.</li>
            <li><strong>Literature Review and Historical Contextualization Phase:</strong> consolidates exploratory data findings with historical contexts through a comprehensive review of scholarly work.</li>
            <li><strong>Database Development Phase:</strong> includes designing and constructing a relational database, as well as standardizing data to streamline computational analysis. </li>
            <li><strong>Data Modeling and Analytical Tool Development Phase:</strong> focuses on further developing models and analytical tools that will leverage Machine Learning and Artificial Intelligence to explore predictive analytics and deeper trend analysis within the relational database, with the added depth from the literature review.</li>
            <li><strong>Publication and Dissemination Phase:</strong> entails releasing research findings in scholarly journals, presenting at conferences, and connecting with wider audiences via exhibitions, talks, and online media to share insights and innovations.</li>
            <li><strong>Curriculum Integration and Educational Outreach Phase:</strong> involves readying the insights and tools from prior stages for incorporation into educational programs, enriching student learning and community engagement with vivid historical narratives and animated data.</li>
