# Dataset: The Tsar's Trans-Atlantic Voyagers
## Overview
The Tsar's Trans-Atlantic Voyagers dataset (TTAV) is a historical dataset describing the migration of over half a million subjects of the Russian Empire to the United States between 1834 and 1897. TTAV is a relational database accompanied with vector data (in other words, location data for all ports, all prominent last known residences, and with schematic itinerary descriptions of all voyage routes).

* Spatial data: Vector data is available in both geojson and shp format (3 files each)
