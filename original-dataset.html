        <h1>Original Dataset Overview</h1>
        <p>The centerpiece of the project is a large dataset provided by the U.S. National Archives consisting of half a million passenger arrival records and ship manifests across six decades (1834-1897). The data is vast and rich, but difficult to use in its raw form. In an effort to increase the usability of the records we reorganized, decoded, tidied, and enhanced. We even built statistical models that allowed us to test the spatial and thematic patterns embedded in the records. We identified the inconsistencies and documented the ambiguities. In a nutshell, we converted messy historical records into data you can feed into your favorite GIS software or visualization app. 
</p>
        <p>This is the most human dataset we have produced. Sure, the records offer woefully limited sketches of the men, women, and children who set sail for the United States, but without them we might not know anything about the existence of the teenage ginger maker named Abraham Limbowsky, who sailed on the Werkendam in 1897, the 24 year-old confectioner from Dunaburg named Salomon Starobin, or the 44 year-old midwife named Marin Ward, who sailed to New York on the Wisconsin in 1891. When taken together, these sketches paint a vibrant portrait of the social landscape of imperial Russia.
